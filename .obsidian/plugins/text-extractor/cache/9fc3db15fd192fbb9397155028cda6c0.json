Teaching hours are now 36 h What's the difference between a Fourier series and Fourier transform? Fourier series: periodic function (period T or L) represented as a sum of trigonometric functions (like sin/cos). Fourier transform: non-periodic function (infinite period) represented as an integral over trigonometric functions A function of period T may be represented as a complex Fourier series. Example 1 Calculate the Fourier Transform of...","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
