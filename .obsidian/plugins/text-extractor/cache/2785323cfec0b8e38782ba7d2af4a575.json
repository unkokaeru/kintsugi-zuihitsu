What is effective teaching? 2. What makes teaching effective? 3. Can you think of an effective teacher? 4. Why were they effective? What did they do or say? How did they act? 5. Can you list all the qualities of an effective lesson? 6. Can you list all the qualities of an effective teacher? 7. How do you know this is the case? In our personal lives… …we have the luxury of being able to argue and have opinions without necessarily having to provide evidence or authority … Sample Footer Text 3 However, in our professional lives… • …we don’t have that luxury, so we have to develop critical argumentation skills • The ability to argue critically helps us to: – Justify the decisions we make – Communicate effectively with colleagues – Strengthen the quality of our academic writing In the teaching world… this also applies to Teacher’s Standards 8: • Part 1: fulfil wider professional responsibilities • Part 2: personal and professional conduct – maintain high standards of ethics and behaviour A professional argument… • Is a conversation about the literature/or a decision you have made between you and your readers/colleagues • Involves co-operation, not coercion • Results in your reader/colleagues trusting you • Must be coherent and organised if it is to be effective 5 parts of planning a critical argument 1. Claim 2. Reasons 3. Evidence 4. Acknowledgement and response 5. Conclusions As a rule of thumb, you should aim to present each element of a critical argument within each paragraph1. Claim • What you think… • A debatable statement that forms the main part of an argument. • A claim is your response to the reader who asks, ‘What do you think?’ • A claim is a statement that readers are unlikely to accept without good reason. It is intended to make them think and/or act differently. • A claim is always debatable and therefore must always be based on reasons. 2. Reasons • Why you think that… • Reasons are included to help support the claim. • Reasons are your response to the reader who asks, ‘Why do you think or say that?’ • Readers won’t accept your claim simply because you said so. Reasons are statements that, taken together, give readers a basis for accepting your claim. • Reasons should provide the logical basis for making a claim. • Because reasons are debatable, they need to be supported by evidence. 3. Evidence • How you know that’s true… • Personal experience, external authority (experts in the field), research, statistics, data etc. that support your reasons. • Evidence is your response to readers who ask, ‘How do you know?’ • Evidence provides the logical basis for your reasoning; it consists of facts that lend concrete support to your claim. 4. Acknowledgement and Response • But what about…? • You may need to acknowledge and respond to possible counter- arguments. • Acknowledgement recognises the counter claims. You respond by indicating the extent to which you disagree (or have taken on board) any counter claims. • Acknowledgement and response is how you respond to readers who ask, ‘What other claims could be made?’ 5. Conclusion or Warrant • Why you think your reasoning is good… • This is the general principle that forms the bridge between the claim and the evidence it is based on. • It is logical reasoning that connects the evidence to the claim. • It moves from step to step in a clear, developmental manner. Let’s have a go… • Taking this question from the starter task: What is effective teaching? • You are going to work with a partner or own your own to write a response … • You will need to find some evidence – books / journals / website to help… • Work through the five parts to complete your argument for what effective teaching is... • Be prepared to produce your work to the group… How did you do? • Now look at your 5 points to each step – what do you notice? 1. Claim 2. Reasons 3. Evidence 4. Acknowledgement and Response 5.
