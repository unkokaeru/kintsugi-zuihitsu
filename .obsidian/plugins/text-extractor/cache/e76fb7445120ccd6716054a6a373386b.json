Extend the code used for those sums to calculate the following. Let xi = i and let yi = 2i + 0.3 for i = 1, 2, . . . , 10 • Calculate ∑ i xi. • Calculate ∑ i yi. • Calculate ∑ i xiyi. • Calculate ¯x and ¯y. • Find the parameters a0 and a1 for a linear regression model of this data. • Check your results are correct (you can use matplotlib library or Excel to plot the data and regression line together). Task 2 When fitting a quadratic, the individual error between a data point and the estimated value is ei as seen in yi = a0 + a1xi + a2x2 i + ei ⇒ ei = yi − a0 + a1xi + a2x2 i Let fi = a0 + a1xi + a2x2 i . Then the overall error function S can be written as S = N −1∑ i=0 e 2 i = N −1∑ i=0 (yi − a0 + a1xi + a2x 2 i )2 = N −1∑ i=0 (yi − fi)2 To find optimal parameters, we need the partial derivative of S to be zero with respect to each parameter ak. For example, ∂fi ∂a0 = 1. i) Find all partial derivatives ∂fi ∂ak . ii) Complete the following derivation for ∂S ∂ak for fitting a quadratic. Numerical Methods - MTH3007 Week 2 - Session 3 ∂S ∂ak = ∂ ∂ak N −1∑ i=0 (y2 i − 2yifi + f 2 i ) = N −1∑ i=0 ∂ ∂ak (y2 i − 2yifi + f 2 i ) = . . . Once you have a simplified sum, set the sum equal to zero, split up the sum into its components, and then form a general equation. iii) Write out the set of three equations formed by letting k = 1, 2, 3. iv) Transform the system of linear equations (in a0, a1, and a2) into a matrix multiplication. v) Using the (xi, yi) data on Blackboard and your Gaussian elimination program, solve the matrix multiplication Ax = b you derived previously to fit a quadratic curve to the data. Task 3 Instead of a function being in terms of powers of a single variable, the model may involve a linear combination of multiple variables x1, . . . , xn. yi = a0 + a1x1,i + a2x2,i + · · · + anxn,i i) Similarly to before, continue the derivation of the set of equations when yi = a0 + a1x1,i + a2x2,i + ei. S = N −1∑ i=0 e2 i = N −1∑ i=0 (yi − a0 − a1x1,i − a2x2,i) 2 ⇒ ∂S ∂a0 = . . . , ∂S ∂a1 = . . . , ∂S ∂a2 = . . . . Use your Gaussian elimination program to solve the matrix multiplication Ax = b formed by equating the partial derivatives to zero. ii) Use the following data to solve for a0, a1, and a2. x1 x2 y 0 0 5 2 1 10 2.5 2 9 1 3 0 4 6 3 7 2 27 iii) Use matplotlib.pyplot to plot your function against the data to check the fit. Numerical Methods - MTH3007 Week 2 - Session 3 Task 4 Multiple linear regression is not limited to obviously linear data. How would you apply multiple linear regression to data you assume follows the relation y = a0xa1 1 xa2 2 . . . xan n ? Reading You should (hopefully still) be reading additional material to provide a solid background as to the methods covered. Before next week, please read the introduction to part 5 and chapter 17 from Capra and Canale. There is also lots of detail in chapters 14 and 15 of Numerical Recipes.","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
