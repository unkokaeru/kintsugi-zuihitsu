MATT WATKINS MWATKINS@LINCOLN.AC.UKMATT WATKINS MWATKINS@LINCOLN.AC.UK FOURIER SERIESFOURIER SERIES Expanding a function in a series of basis functions, particularly periodic sin and cosines can be very useful. May help analysing a function. Can be used make a \u0000lter - removing high or low frequency noise. Useful solving some differential equations. ... Suppose we have a periodic function - this means that where is the period. Assume we can expand the function as a sum of (known) functions with the same periodicity where . Check that all the and have periodicity (by considering the functions at and ).

To do this we multiply by the function whose coef\u0000cient we wish to \u0000nd, and integrate over . For instance, to \u0000nd the coef\u0000cient of we multiply by and integrate over the period: Using the orthogonality relations only the term containing survives, giving am bm T am cos( ) mπx l = cos( )ϕm mπx l (x)f(x)dx∫ l −l ϕm = (x) dx + (x) [ (x) + (x)]dx∫ l −l ϕm a0 2 ∫ l −l ϕm ∑ n=1 ∞ anϕn bn ψn = (x)dx + [ (x) (x)dx + (x) (x)dx] a0 2 ∫ l −l ϕm ∑ n=1 ∞ an ∫ l −l ϕm ϕn bn ∫ l −l ϕm ψn am = (x)f(x)dxam 1 l ∫ l −l ϕm To \u0000nd we multiply by and integrate over the period: Using the orthogonality relations only the term containing survives, giving Check that and bm ψm (x)f(x)dx∫ l −l ψm = (x) dx + (x) [ (x) + (x)]dx∫ l −l ψm a0 2 ∫ l −l ψm ∑ n=1 ∞ anϕn bn ψn = (x)dx + [ (x) (x)dx + (x) (x)dx] a0 2 ∫ l −l ψm ∑ n=1 ∞ an ∫ l −l ψm ϕn bn ∫ l −l ψm ψn bm = (x)f(x)dxbm 1 l ∫ l −l ψm = (x)f(x)dxam 1 l ∫ l −l ϕm = (x)f(x)dxbm 1 l ∫ l −l ψm NUMERICAL FOURIER SERIESNUMERICAL FOURIER SERIES To calculate the terms in the fourier series we need to numerically integrate our function. Assuming that we have a series of evenly spaced values we can simply calculate the integrals using the trapezium rule as This discretization is very similar to what we did in previous weeks - we discretize the period along the axis with points in each period. The th point is a replica of th. We don't want to include the th point at because it is the same as the \u0000rst one. will be the period of the function divided by the number of points, . Suppose we want to sample a function with period with n = 4 points in each period. This means the 5 th point will be at the beginning of the next period. The spacing between the points will be the period divided by the 4 spaces between the 5 points. So . Note that there is a maximum frequency of wave that can be represented.

The expansion can be written in terms of complex exponentials instead of and terms - instead of our functions and we use and expand as This is just rewriting the series, because are just linear combinations of and . The also satisfy orthogonality relations, and the coef\u0000cients can be found in the same way - multiply by the complex conjugate of the function whose coef\u0000cient you want to \u0000nd and then integrate over the period. sin cos sin cos ϕ ψ (x) = exp( )χn inxπ l f(x) f(x) = (x)∑ n=−∞ ∞ cnχn χn ϕn ψn χn = (x)f(x)dxcn ∫ l −l χ∗ n SOLVING DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONSSOLVING DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS Differential equations can often be transformed into algebraic form using Fourier series.
