The title of the project. 2. A brief description of the project. 3. Connection of the project with your previous studies 4. A literature survey (see later). 5. A list of references. 6. Equipment and facilities required. 7. Likely cost of consumables required. 8. An action plan showing what has to be done and the date by which it will be completed (e.g. Gantt chart) 9.

Arrangements made for regular discussions with your supervisor. 30/09/2025 11 Research Plan: Literature Survey The aim of a literature survey is to identify (all) published material relevant to your project or work. • It is essentially an information gathering exercise. • The survey should be a report on the literature search and not on the literature itself. Example Literature survey (first few entries) Title: Literature concerning approaches to magnetic quantum dots Author Year System Schwartz et al 2003 Co2+ and Ni2+ doped ZnO QDs Norris et al 2001 Mn2+ doped ZnSe QDs Wang et al 2007 Mn2+ doped CdSe/ZnS QDs Kim et al 2006 CdSe/ZnS QDs and Fe3O4 nanoparticles in mesoporous silica spheres 30/09/2025 12 Research Plan: Literature Review The aim of a literature review is to identify, evaluate and interpret (all) relevant published material. • Compare the results of various works: is there a general consensus or are findings contested? • Identify best methods - be critical! • Highlight ‘seminal’ studies (strongly influencing later developments) • Highlight ‘gaps’ in the literature; and • Finish by placing your work in the context of the literature you have reviewed. A short literature review should (usually) be included in the introduction of your final report. 30/09/2025 13 Research Plan: Work Schedule Ganntcharts are used to plan projects or a series of tasks https://www.smartsheet.com/ 30/09/2025 14 Research plan marking scheme Project Management and Professionalism Marking scheme Learning outcomes met: LO1, LO3 Failing 40-49 50-59 60-69 70-79 >79% Research Plan • Very poorly presented and difficult to follow. • No equations/tables or figures are present. • No evidence of reflection • No references are reported. • Very Poor understanding of the project. • Very poor reflection about the objective of the project. • Poorly presented and difficult to follow • Some Equations/tables / figures are present. • Limited evidence of reflection • Limited references with inconsistency in style. • Limited understanding of the project. • Some of the objectives of the project are not realistic or cannot be performed in an adequate timeline. • Fair attempt at a logical structure using standard format. • Fair use of equation/diagra ms/tables and their presentation. • Fair range of key references used and presented in a standard style with only minor inconsistencies. • Fair understanding of the project. • Fairly good timeline of the objectives. • Generally, coherently, and well structured (date, section, title, page numbers, eq. number etc). • Good use and presentation of the equations/diagram s/tables • Good range of key references used and consistently in a standard style. • Good critical analysis and good reflection on the significance of the project. • Good proposal and realistic timeline of the main objectives. • Generally, coherently and well structured (date, section, title, page numbers, eq. number etc). • Very good use and presentation of the equations/diagrams/ tables. • Very good range of key references used and consistently in a standard style. • Very good critical analysis and good reflection on the significance of the project. • Excellent proposal and good timeline of the main objectives of the project. • Excellent presentation and use of equations/diagrams/ta bles. • Wide range of key references used and presented accurately and consistently in a standard style. • Clearly developed, showing a thorough understanding of the theory behind the project. • An excellent critical and concise reflection on the significance of the project. • Outstanding proposal with ambitious objectives in a good timeline frame. 30/09/2025 15 Logbook (1) • Should be used to record ALL work done on your project, as you do it. • Reading • Planning • Method • Calculations • Simulations Logbooks can be collected from my office INB3128 starting Thursday 2nd October 2025 30/09/2025 16 Logbook (2) On paper, A4.

A student that has made limited effort to manage their project and has needed considerable assistance to plan, send their work for feedback and communicate. A student that has engaged but needed assistance to manage their project, to timely send work for feedback, plan work and/or has been weak at communicating A student that has overall sent work for feedback in a timely manner, has planned and organized their work and has been consistent in their communication. A professional and engaged student who has sent work for feedback in a timely manner, taken responsibility for planning and organizing project and communicated effectively. An excellent engaging student who has sent their work for feedback in a timely manner, taken full responsibility for planning and independently organizing project and communicated very effectively. 30/09/2025 19 Meetings with Supervisor • 30 minutes every two weeks. • You are responsible for initially contacting and arranging a regular time and location for these meetings with your supervisor. • Lost slots cannot be carried over (unless for extenuating circumstances backed by the form...) • Students may ask for an extra session, but the supervisor may not be able to accommodate them; extra session means one less regular session. • Plan your meeting beforehand (e.g. bring findings and list of questions) to make the most of your contact time! • First meeting: before sending your research plan for feedback (indicative deadline for research plan is 22/10/25) 30/09/2025 20 Report Should include: • A title page • An abstract (max. 150) • A table of contents • An introduction • A method section • Results/calculations/simulations, etc. • A discussion • A conclusion • Acknowledgements • References • An appendix Approx word count 10,000 but this may depend on your project (discuss with your supervisor).
