What's the difference between a Fourier series and Fourier transform?
- Fourier series: periodic function (period T or L) represented as a sum of trigonometric functions (like sin/cos).
- Fourier transform: non-periodic function (infinite period) represented as an integral over trigonometric functions (like a continuous sum). often comlex exponentials instead of sin/cos functions.

A function of period T may be represented as a complex Fourier series.
