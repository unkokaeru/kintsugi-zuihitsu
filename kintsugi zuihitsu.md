# Kintsugi Zuihitsu

**Kintsugi** (金継ぎ), the art of golden repair, transforms brokenness into beauty by highlighting fractures with precious metal rather than hiding them. **Zuihitsu** (随筆), meaning "following the brush," represents the Japanese literary form of spontaneous, personal reflection that flows naturally from thought to thought.

This vault embodies both concepts: **kintsugi** in how it transforms scattered thoughts and broken learning attempts into a unified golden network of knowledge, and **zuihitsu** in its organic, wandering structure that follows curiosity rather than rigid categorization.

The structure separates [[Clear|transparent knowledge]] that can be shared publicly from [[Cloudy|protected development]] requiring privacy, while maintaining natural connections between all areas of exploration.

*"Following the brush wherever curiosity leads, mending each broken understanding with golden connections."*
