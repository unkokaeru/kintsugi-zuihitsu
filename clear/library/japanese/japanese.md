Language learning reference for Japanese acquisition. This collection documents vocabulary, grammar patterns, kanji knowledge, and cultural insights accumulated through systematic study.

## Learning Approach

Structured approach using **WaniKani** for kanji and vocabulary acquisition, **Anki** for spaced repetition, and supplementary cultural materials. Focus on building strong foundations before advancing to complex materials.

## Knowledge Areas

- **Kanji studies** - character meanings, readings, and stroke patterns
- **Vocabulary** - core words with usage examples and context
- **Grammar patterns** - sentence structures and particle usage
- **Cultural context** - social customs, historical background, aesthetic principles
- **Reading materials** - annotated texts with comprehension notes

The systematic memorisation techniques developed here inform the spaced repetition approaches used in [[Omoikane|academic mathematics]] and other learning domains.
