International relations analysis through news summaries and historical context. This collection documents global developments, power dynamics, and systemic patterns that shape world events.

## Learning Approach

News analysis from sources like The Economist and Financial Times, combined with historical background research. Focus on understanding underlying patterns rather than just current events.

## Knowledge Areas

- **Current events** - summarised news stories with personal analysis
- **Historical context** - background information for understanding present developments
- **Regional dynamics** - specific geographic areas and their unique challenges
- **Economic relationships** - trade patterns, monetary policy, development trends
- **Power structures** - military capabilities, diplomatic influence, soft power

The systematic analysis required shares methodological approaches with the strategic thinking developed through [[Chess|chess study]] and applied in [[Hachiman|migration planning]].
