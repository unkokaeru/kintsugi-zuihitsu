# Library

Reference knowledge and learning methodologies across various domains. Each area documents what has been learned, progress tracking, and approaches that prove effective. The collection grows organically through curiosity rather than predetermined academic categories.

Unlike the [[Project|project implementations]], these represent foundational understanding that informs but doesn't directly execute specific outcomes.
