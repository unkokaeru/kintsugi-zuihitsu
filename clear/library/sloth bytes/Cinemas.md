| Given an array of seats, return the maximum number of new people which can be seated, as long as there is at least a gap of **2 seats** between people.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| - Empty seats are given as `0`.<br>    <br>- Occupied seats are given as `1`.<br>    <br>- Don't move any seats which are already occupied, even if they are less than 2 seats apart. Consider only the gaps between new seats and existing seats.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
