| ## **Sloth's Meal Time**                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Sloth is a very habitual person. He eats breakfast at 7:00 a.m. each morning, lunch at 12:00 p.m. and dinner at 7:00 p.m. in the evening.                                                                   |
| Create a function that takes in the current time as a string and determines the duration of time before Sloth's next meal.                                                                                  |
| Represent this as an array with the first and second elements representing hours and minutes, respectively.                                                                                                 |
