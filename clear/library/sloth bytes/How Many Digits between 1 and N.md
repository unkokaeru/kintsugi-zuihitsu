| Imagine you took all the numbers between 0 and `n` and concatenated them together into a long string.                                         |
| How many digits are there between 0 and `n`? Write a function that can calculate this.                                                        |
| There are 0 digits between 0 and 1, there are 9 digits between 0 and 10 and there are 189 digits between 0 and 100.                           |
| ### **Examples**                                                                                                                              |
| ```<br>digits(1)<br>output = 0<br><br>digits(10)<br>output = 9<br><br>digits(100)<br>output = 189<br><br>digits(2020)<br>output = 6969<br>``` |
