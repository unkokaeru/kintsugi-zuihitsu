# FFMS

```
Mon, Tues, Weds: William cooks
Thurs, Fri, Sun: Maicey cooks
Sat: BOTH OF US :) (couple cookbook split recipes?)
```

Make FFMS - stores what food is in the house, logs what meals we normally eat, suggests optimal food and what to buy

Make this referenced correctly by [[cooking]], too.
