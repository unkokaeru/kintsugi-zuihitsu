# Cooking

Culinary techniques, recipes, and ingredient understanding through practical experimentation. This collection documents successful recipes, failed attempts, and learned techniques that transform raw ingredients into nourishment.

## Learning Approach

Experimentation-based learning with recipe collection and technique practice. Focus on understanding fundamental principles rather than just following instructions.

## Knowledge Areas

- **Recipes** - tested and refined dishes with personal modifications
- **Techniques** - knife skills, heat control, timing, and seasoning
- **Ingredients** - seasonal selection, storage, and preparation methods
- **Flavour profiles** - acid balance, umami, aromatic combinations
- **Equipment mastery** - tool selection and maintenance

Each failed dish provides valuable education in timing and technique that strengthens future attempts, much like the iterative improvement approach used in [[koto|piano practice]].
