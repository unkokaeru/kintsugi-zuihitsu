# 🥄 **Step-by-Step Instructions**

## 1. **Prep**

- Preheat oven to **350°F (176°C)**
- *Optional*: Line pan with parchment for easy removal

## 2. **Shortbread Crust**

1. **Mix Dry Ingredients**
	- Combine flour, powdered sugar, and salt in a bowl
2. **Add Melted Butter**
	- Pour in melted butter
	- Mix with a wooden spatula, spoon, or your hands until crumbly
3. **Press Into Pan**
	- Evenly press mixture into the bottom of your pan
4. **Bake**
	- Bake **20–25 minutes** until edges are just golden

> [!tip]
> Use powdered sugar in the crust for a melt-in-mouth texture. For the filling, stick with granulated sugar for classic chew.
>
> Mixing tools: Wooden spatula for crust; whisk (or fork if needed) for filling.

## 3. **Lemon Filling**

1. **Zest the Lemons**
	- Wash lemons
	- Use a microplane or fine grater to remove only the yellow outer layer (the zest)
	- *Avoid the white pith—it's bitter!*

> [!info]
> **Lemon zest = just the yellow skin, not the white pith.**
> Zest before juicing for max flavor.

1. **Combine Sugar \& Zest**
	- Rub zest into sugar with fingers to release oils
2. **Add Flour**
	- Stir in flour until evenly mixed
3. **Add Eggs**
	- Crack eggs into a bowl
	- Whisk thoroughly until yolks and whites are fully combined
	- *A whisk is ideal for a smooth, lump-free filling. A fork works if you don't have a whisk—just mix well!*
4. **Add Lemon Juice**
	- Squeeze lemons for 1 cup juice
	- Add to mixture and whisk until smooth

> [!tip]
> **Mix eggs well before adding other ingredients.**
> Overmixing can add air—just whisk until smooth.

## 4. **Assembly \& Baking**

1. **Pour Filling on Hot Crust**
	- If the filling sat and separated, whisk well to recombine before pouring
2. **Bake**
	- Bake at **350°F (176°C)** for **20–25 minutes** (9" x 13" pan)
	- Filling should jiggle like Jell-O, not slosh

> [!warning]
> If you pour separated filling, the bars may bake unevenly. **Always re-whisk before pouring!**

## 5. **Cooling \& Serving**

- Cool completely at room temp, at least **2–3 hours**
- **Chilling for 8 hours or overnight is ideal**—this improves texture and makes slicing easier
- Dust with powdered sugar just before serving

> [!tip]
> Chilling longer (up to 8 hours or overnight) is not only safe, but recommended for best results.
