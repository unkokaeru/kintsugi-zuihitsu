> [!quote] José Raúl Capablanca
> "Chess is a mental torture."

Strategic thinking and pattern recognition through the 64-square universe of chess. This collection documents openings, tactics, endgame patterns, and game analysis drawn from various sources.

## Learning Approach

Mixed sources including online platforms, books, and game studies. Focus areas include opening theory, tactical patterns, positional understanding, and endgame technique.

## Knowledge Areas

- **Opening repertoire** - principled development and central control
- **Tactical patterns** - pins, forks, discoveries, and combinations
- **Endgame studies** - theoretical positions and practical technique
- **Game analysis** - annotated games and position evaluation
- **Checkmate patterns** - systematic mating attacks

The mental discipline required connects naturally to other analytical pursuits, particularly the systematic problem-solving approaches used in [[puro|competitive programming]].
