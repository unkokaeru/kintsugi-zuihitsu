Musical excellence through piano mastery. Current focus on learning Claire de Lune as quickly as possible, with potential expansion to broader piano proficiency.

## Current Goal

Master Debussy's Claire de Lune with both technical accuracy and musical expression. Priority on speed of acquisition while maintaining quality.

## Learning Areas

- **Technical foundation** - finger independence, hand positioning, pedal technique
- **Musical interpretation** - phrasing, dynamics, tempo control
- **Practice methodology** - efficient repetition and error correction
- **Performance readiness** - memorization and stage presence

The disciplined practice approach mirrors the systematic improvement methods used in [[puro|competitive programming]] and structured learning techniques from [[omoikane|academic work]].
