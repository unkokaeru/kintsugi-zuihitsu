# Puro

Competitive programming excellence through the Wikibot challenge. Algorithmic mastery applied to automate Wikipedia navigation between random pages using only internal HTML links.

## Competition Overview

**Wikibot** is a programming competition inspired by the "Wikipedia race" game, where competitors develop automated solutions to navigate from one random Wikipedia page to another page by using only internal links, optimizing for both efficiency and code quality.

## Technical Challenges

- **Path optimization** - finding shortest routes between arbitrary Wikipedia pages
- **Algorithmic efficiency** - balancing search strategies with performance constraints
- **Code quality** - readable, maintainable solutions under competitive pressure
- **Network optimization** - handling HTTP requests and parsing HTML effectively

## Scoring Categories

Performance metrics include steps taken, computation speed, memory usage, code elegance, and creative approaches. Success requires both algorithmic thinking and implementation excellence.

The systematic problem-solving approach builds on analytical skills developed through [[chess|chess tactics]] and connects to optimization thinking used in [[kuebiko|schedule management]].
