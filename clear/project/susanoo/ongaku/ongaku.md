# Ongaku

Creative mastery through systematic music production learning. Comprehensive exploration of FL Studio capabilities to achieve technical and artistic superiority.

## Learning Approach

Systematic study of each aspect of music production rather than random experimentation. Focus on understanding underlying principles before creative application.

## Learning Areas

- **DAW proficiency** - FL Studio workflow, plug-in usage, automation
- **Sound design** - synthesis techniques, sampling, effect processing
- **Mixing techniques** - EQ application, compression, spatial placement
- **Composition principles** - harmonic structure, rhythm, arrangement
- **Creative process** - idea development, project management, completion strategies

The methodical skill acquisition connects to systematic approaches used in [[../Chess|chess improvement]] and the structured learning philosophy of [[../Japanese|language acquisition]].
