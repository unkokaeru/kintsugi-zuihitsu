# Kagi

Mechanical intuition through lock picking mastery. Physical puzzle solving that requires tactile sensitivity, systematic methodology, and understanding of pin tumbler mechanisms.

## Equipment

Practice locks and pick sets from Amazon, with the ultimate goal of unlocking the garden shed.

## Learning Areas

- **Pin tumbler theory** - understanding binding order and feedback
- **Tool proficiency** - pick selection and tension control
- **Tactile development** - feedback interpretation and click recognition
- **Progressive difficulty** - from basic practice locks to real-world applications

The mechanical sensitivity developed here complements the precision required for [[Koto|piano technique]] and systematic problem-solving approaches used throughout other skill domains.
