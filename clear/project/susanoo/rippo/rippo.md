# Rippo

Geometric mastery through systematic Rubik's cube solving. Three-dimensional puzzle mastery that combines algorithmic memorization with spatial intelligence and speed development.

## Learning Approach

Methodical progression from basic layer-by-layer solving to advanced CFOP methods. Focus on algorithm memorization, muscle memory development, and consistent sub-minute times.

## Skill Areas

- **Method mastery** - CFOP system, F2L techniques, algorithm memorization
- **Speed development** - finger tricks, flow optimization, timer practice
- **Pattern recognition** - case identification, look-ahead techniques
- **Equipment optimization** - cube selection, tensioning, maintenance
- **Consistency training** - reliable execution under time pressure

The systematic approach to memorization and pattern recognition parallels techniques used in [[japanese|language acquisition]] and connects to the rapid processing skills needed for [[puro|competitive programming]].
