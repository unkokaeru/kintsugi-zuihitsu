[Dōsojin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C5%8Dsojin) (道祖神), the "ancestor deities of the road," serve as boundary guardians who protect travellers while enabling safe passage through unfamiliar territories. These protective spirits stand at crossroads and village boundaries, offering divine guidance to those venturing into unknown domains.

In the context of recreating commonly used websites, Dōsojin represents the systematic approach needed for digital reconstruction—ensuring safe navigation through complex web architectures while maintaining functionality across new technological boundaries. The goal is to rebuild sites like Chess.com, Monkeytype, and NYT Games with modern approaches, custom features, and no subscription dependencies.

# Implementation

## Phase 1: Mapping (巣)

Catalog current website dependencies and analyse essential features. Document usage patterns, data flows, and technical requirements for each target site.

## Phase 2: Reconstruction (飛翔)

Build core functionality using modern web technologies while preserving familiar user experiences. Focus on feature parity before enhancement.

## Phase 3: Enhancement (空)

Add custom features, improved performance, and personalized functionality that exceeds original capabilities.
