# Convolution Theorem

The **Convolution Theorem** is derived by ==taking the Fourier transform of the convolution== to ==transform a more complicated integral into simple multiplication==.

**The Convolution Theorem** is defined as::

$$
\mathcal{F}[f(x)\ast g(x)]=\sqrt{ 2\pi } \tilde{f}(k)\tilde{g}(k)
$$

We can also flip the theorem to simplify the calculation of some Fourier transforms with convolutions::

$$
\mathcal{F}[f(x)g(x)]=\frac{1}{\sqrt{ 2\pi }}\tilde{f}(k)\ast \tilde{g}(k)
$$

With a similar proof.
