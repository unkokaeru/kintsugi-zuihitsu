# Laplace Transform

The **Laplace transform** of a function $f(t)$ is defined by ==$\tilde{f}(s)=\int_{0}^{\infty}f(t)e^{ -st }dt$==.

**Laplace transforms** can exist when ==$\lim_{ t \to \infty }f(t)\ne{0}$==, when the Fourier transform as $t$ tends towards $\infty$ it does not exist.

**Laplace transforms** are often used when ==$t>0$, e.g. initial-value problems==.

Laplace transforms are often denoted by ==$\mathcal{L}[f(t)]$==.

## Example One

Calculate $\mathcal{L}(\cos \omega t)$::$\frac{s}{s^2 + \omega^2}$.

## Example Two

Calculate $\mathcal{L}(\sin \omega t)$::$\frac{\omega}{s^2 + \omega^2}$.
