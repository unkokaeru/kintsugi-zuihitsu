# Heaviside step Function

Defined as ==$H(t)=\begin{cases}1 & \text{for }t\gt0 \\ 0 & \text{for }t\lt{0}\end{cases}$==, usually where ==$H(0)=\frac{1}{2}$==, too; originally defined to help model within ==electrical engineering==.

The ==step function== and the ==$\delta$ function== are related by ==$H^{\prime}(t)=\delta(t)$==, since the ==gradient== at the middle of the step function is ==infinite== at $t$.
