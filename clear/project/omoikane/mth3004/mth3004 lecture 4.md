# Mth3004 Lecture 4

- Motivation (intrinsic/extrinsic, underpinned by self-efficacy) & interest (personal/situational).
	- [[Motivation]] - An inner drive to action.
		- [[Intrinsic motivation]] - intrinsic motivation occurs when we act without any obvious external rewards. We simply enjoy an activity or see it as an opportunity to explore, learn, and actualize our potentials.
		- [[Extrinsic motivation]] - when we are motivated to participate or behave in an activity because we want to be rewarded or avoid punishment.
	- [[Interest]] - A fascination with something.
		- [[Personal interest]] - …
		- [[Situational interest]] - …
	- [[Self-efficacy]] - The belief that you are capable to carry out a task of reach a goal (Bandura, 1986).
	- Expectancy against self-efficacy.
	- Hattie effect sizes (2018) - motivation has an effect size of 0.42, where 0.5 is one GCSE grade leap.
- Theories of learning: behaviourism, cognitivism/constructivism/connectivism.
- Zone of Achieved Development.

## Learning Theories

### Dewey (Experiential Learning)

- **What is important?** Learning by doing; education is life itself, not preparation for life.
- **Why important to teaching?** Centers on meaningful, real-world experience to foster engagement and critical thinking.
- **Impact on teaching?** Promotes learner-centered methods, project-based and inquiry-based approaches.
- **Support effective teaching?** Connects to scaffolding, pupil voice, and building on prior experience as highlighted by Husbands and Pearce.

### Pavlov (Classical Conditioning)

- **What is important?** Learning occurs by forming associations between neutral and meaningful stimuli.
- **Why important to teaching?** Recognizes how classroom cues and routines shape emotional responses and behaviour.
- **Impact on teaching?** Enables positive associations with learning activities and reduces anxiety via environmental signals.
- **Support effective teaching?** Helps structure safe routines and positive reinforcement; supports inclusive pedagogy claims.

### Skinner (Operant Conditioning)

- **What is important?** Learning as a function of reinforcement and punishment; behaviour is shaped by consequences.
- **Why important to teaching?** Provides evidence-based approaches to classroom management and motivation.
- **Impact on teaching?** Uses reward systems and structured feedback to reinforce desirable behaviours; breaks learning into steps.
- **Support effective teaching?** Enables assessment for learning and systematic support; aligns with behaviour management claims.

### Tolman (Cognitive Maps & Latent Learning)

- **What is important?** Learners develop mental models and can learn through observation without direct reinforcement.
- **Why important to teaching?** Emphasizes meaningful cognitive organization and exploration for knowledge acquisition.
- **Impact on teaching?** Encourages discovery learning, flexible thinking, and structured environments for mapping knowledge.
- **Support effective teaching?** Scaffolds mental model development, supports investigation, hypothesis formation, and holistic understanding.

### Vygotsky (Social Constructivism/Zone of Proximal Development)

- **What is important?** Cognitive development happens via social interaction, language, and culture; ZPD is central.
- **Why important to teaching?** Stresses collaborative learning, scaffolding, and the role of guided support for optimal growth.
- **Impact on teaching?** Promotes peer learning, dialogue, and adaptive support that responds to student needs and readiness.
- **Support effective teaching?** Directly aligns with claims about scaffolding, building on prior experience, pupil voice, and promoting reasoning suggested by Husbands and Pearce.

### Piaget (Stages of Cognitive Development)

- **What is important?** Children actively construct knowledge, progressing through distinctive cognitive stages.
- **Why important to teaching?** Highlights readiness and developmental appropriateness in learning activities.
- **Impact on teaching?** Encourages discovery learning, hands-on experience, and differentiation by developmental stage.
- **Support effective teaching?** Supports scaffolding, connecting to prior learning, and developmental differentiation.

### Bandura (Social Learning Theory)

- **What is important?** Learners acquire behaviours through observation, imitation, and modeling.
- **Why important to teaching?** Demonstrates the importance of modeling, peer influence, and social context in behavioural and cognitive learning.
- **Impact on teaching?** Promotes teacher role modeling, positive classroom relationships, and peer collaboration.
- **Support effective teaching?** Enhances collaborative learning environments and positive reinforcement, consonant with effective pedagogy claims.

### Sweller (Cognitive Load Theory)

- **What is important?** Learning is constrained by working memory capacity; instructional design must manage cognitive load.
- **Why important to teaching?** Guides teachers on breaking down information to optimize mental processing.
- **Impact on teaching?** Encourages chunking, use of models/examples, reducing extraneous information.
- **Support effective teaching?** Fosters clear structure and builds on prior knowledge, supporting inclusive pedagogy.

### Miller (Working Memory Theory)

- **What is important?** Working memory has limited capacity (about 7±2 items); crucial for learning and comprehension.
- **Why important to teaching?** Informs instructional pacing and design for cognitive support.
- **Impact on teaching?** Promotes chunking, repetition, step-by-step instructions, and external supports.
- **Support effective teaching?** Justifies structuring lessons, providing supports, and attentive inclusivity for learning differences.

### Maslow (Hierarchy of Needs)

- **What is important?** Motivation is hierarchical; basic needs must be met before academic achievement and self-actualization.
- **Why important to teaching?** Calls attention to holistic well-being, not just cognitive development, for effective learning.
- **Impact on teaching?** Encourages safe, supportive environments and recognition of non-academic barriers to learning.
- **Support effective teaching?** Supports inclusive pedagogy and responsive teaching aligned with individualized needs.

These summaries capture each theory's core features, their significance for teaching, classroom impacts, and alignment with Husbands and Pearce's (2014) research claims.
