# Formal Methods in Mathematics

Mathematics, as the solid grounds on which many natural sciences stand, draws its power from a sound logic foundation. In fact, the rapid advances in modern mathematics are deeply rooted into a need for formalising the mathematical theories discovered thus far, starting off of core axioms and proving results (theorems) using propositional logic.

On the other hand, being a social, human-powered activity, doing mathematics is prone to errors. It is not uncommon - even in high level research by experienced mathematicians - to have mathematical theorems rendered useless once flaws are found in the arguments used in their proofs. In a different direction, some mathematical results - such as the famous Feit-Thompson theorem - are so difficult to prove that it is hard for humans to parse whether these were in fact proved correctly.

In the 1980s, first (user friendly) proof assistants began to surface. These are computer programmes based on higher order logic on which one can effectively formalise mathematical theories without ambiguity (due to computers' boolean nature), allowing one to fully verify whether a given proof of a mathematical theorem is indeed correct.

This project dives into the realm of formal methods in mathematics, and can range from its logic foundation to automated reasoning and the modern use of proof assistants such as PVS, Rocq or Lean. Depending on the student's affinity, the project can focus on topics such as: (in)completeness of mathematical theories based on GÃ¶del's fundamental work; aspects and applications of formal logic and automated reasoning; or hands-on computer assisted proofs with interactive theorem provers.
