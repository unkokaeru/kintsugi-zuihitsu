# The Quantum Realm - is it Bigger than We Think?

**Original video**: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE0yfsD1xDA>.

- Quantum theory - Copenhagen most common, but many other interpretations; if bits can't be disproven then they stick around and possibly confuse more. Calculations seem valid despite contradictory logic, though.
- Normally only in the micro-scale, but the Necker cube appears in the macro scale, as does the Lissajous figure (both representing superposition in an optical way). Cognition, too, doesn't follow standard probability theory - maybe has links? Not implying that the brain is a quantum computer, though.
- Conjucation fallacy further connotes this non-classical cognition - why don't humans follow mathematical logic?
- All seems like logic yapping icl - breaks down that logical interference correlates with quantum interference, but really feels like confusion with nomenclature, not really causation or a real relationship at all
- Ehhhhhhh I guess quantum stuff is just probabiltiy anyway tho, maybe related but I think just related by probabilistic identities being constant throughout classical and quantum theory instead of cognition and quantum theory being related
- Historically, I wonder if logical mathematics ever coincides with new theory?
- Side note: review my Manim stuff, could be useful for future presentation bits
- Hilbert space pretty cool for probability bits (state vectors and bits)
- icl I think it's way cooler writing about something that I think is wrong, pretty cool/interesting maybe
