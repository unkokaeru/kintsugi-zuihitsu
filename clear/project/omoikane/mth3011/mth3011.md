## Course Components

- **Communication** (35%): Coursework (Seminar Reviews) and Presentation
- **Project** (65%): Planning/Logbook and Report/Viva

## Learning Outcomes

- [ ] **LO1**: Undertake an independent programme of work in mathematics and/or physics aligned with the course subject specialism, that includes the analysis, interpretation, and critical evaluation of the results to reach conclusions that are appropriate for the particular project.
- [ ] **LO2**: Write a full and clear report that conforms to pre-agreed guidelines.
- [ ] **LO3**: Manage time, setting, and achieving appropriate targets throughout the project, including the provision of any necessary documentation, so that the work is completed by the stated deadline.
- [ ] **LO4**: Present and defend the results of the project in a viva.
- [ ] **LO5**: Critically apply concepts and laws from physics and/or mathematics to evaluate the scientific content of a research work.
- [ ] **LO6**: Demonstrate awareness of current themes of research in mathematics and physics by communicating in a style accessible to a lay audience on material delivered in a series of research seminars.
- [ ] **LO7**: Demonstrate awareness of modern research practices by presenting a critical review of a research paper in the form of a short seminar presentation.
