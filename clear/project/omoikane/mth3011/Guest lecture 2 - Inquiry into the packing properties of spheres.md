# Inquiry into the Packing Properties of Spheres

$$
\text{Packing fraction} = \eta=\frac{N_{v}}{V_{\text{packing}}}
$$

$N$ is the number of spheres, $v$ is the volume of a sphere, and $V_{\text{packing}}$ is the total volume occupied.

Spheres spawned randomly and allowed to fall to partially fill a container - this simulation can then calculate the packing fraction over several iterations, where each iteration may vary.

This is important to understand commercial packing, like with filling a Maltesers bag.

$$
\Delta N=N \frac{\Delta n}{\eta}\approx |\eta_{1}-\eta_{2}|/
$$
