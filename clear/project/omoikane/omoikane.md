[Omoikane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omoikane) (思兼), the god of collective wisdom and strategic counsel, served as advisor to the gods in their most complex situations. His name means "bringing together many thoughts"—representing the synthesis of diverse perspectives into unified solutions.

In the context of academic mathematics work, Omoikane embodies the systematic methodology that combines multiple learning techniques into comprehensive understanding. The approach integrates pre-lecture preparation, active questioning, spaced repetition, and meta-level practice to achieve deep mathematical competency.

# Methodology

1. **Pre-Lecture Preparation**: Create priming notes before each lecture to establish mental frameworks for new concepts.
2. **Active Questioning**: During lectures, focus on writing questions rather than passive note-taking to maintain engagement and identify knowledge gaps.
3. **Post-Lecture Processing**: Answer generated questions immediately after lectures for active recall, converting successful Q&As into flashcard material.
4. **Spaced Repetition**: Use flashcard systems to ensure long-term retention of mathematical concepts and procedures.
5. **Past Paper Practice**: Complete historical exams once material is memorized, focusing on application rather than recall.
6. **Meta-Level Creation**: Develop original practice problems that require instructor-level understanding, potentially exceeding module scope.
7. **Cheat Sheet Development**: Create ultra-concise reference materials before exams, then comprehensive notes after completion.

The systematic synthesis approach connects to pattern recognition skills developed through [[chess|chess study]] and the structured learning methods used in [[japanese|language acquisition]].
