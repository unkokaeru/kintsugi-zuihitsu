# Least Squares Regression

Least squares regression is, given a set of paired observations $(x_{0},y_{0}),(x_{1},y_{1}),\dots,(x_{n-1},y_{n-1})$, we assuming a linear relationship defined by $y_{i}=a_{0}+a_{1}x_{i}+e$, where $e$ is the error (or residual) between the model and the observations; this is then minimised where $e_{i}=y_{i}-a_{0}-a_{1}x_{i}$
