[Kuebiko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuebiko) (久延毘古), the scarecrow god of comprehensive awareness, represents stationary omniscience—unable to move but possessing complete knowledge of all that occurs. His immobility paired with universal awareness symbolizes the optimization mindset needed for effective time management.

In the context of schedule refinement, Kuebiko embodies the systematic observation required to identify inefficiencies and optimize patterns. The goal is comprehensive time tracking, pattern analysis, and automated systems that protect against productivity loss while enhancing natural work rhythms.

Point scoring system for things I do in my day, incl. negative scores, able to make new scores with LLM-based inference, then make an app using the Yatagarasu workflow but for my schedule, combining this points idea from my to-do with the schedule adventure idea. Ensure this covers setting work hours for academic, personal, and professional areas (LSA, TCT, TUTORING).

# Implementation

## Phase 1: Observation (巣)

Comprehensive time tracking and pattern analysis. Document all activities, transition times, and energy fluctuations to establish complete baseline understanding.

## Phase 2: Optimization (飛翔)

Systematic efficiency improvements through reduced friction, eliminated inefficiencies, and optimized workflows. Focus on compound time savings.

## Phase 3: Integration (空)

Automated intelligence systems that continuously monitor and adjust schedules based on pattern recognition and predictive optimization.
