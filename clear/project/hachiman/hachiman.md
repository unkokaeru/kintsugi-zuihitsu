[Hachiman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hachiman) (八幡), the strategic war god and divine protector, represents peace maintained through understanding and comprehensive preparation. Known for divine intervention during the Mongol invasions, Hachiman embodies defensive wisdom and systematic strategic thinking.

In the context of Google service migration, Hachiman represents the analytical framework needed for complex system transitions while maintaining security and functionality. The goal is systematic replacement of Google dependencies with self-hosted alternatives—email servers, file storage, and productivity tools.
