[Inari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inari_%C5%8Ckami) (稲荷), the shape-shifting deity of transformation and resourcefulness, represents the adaptive nature required for digital reconstruction. Their ability to manifest in different forms while maintaining essential function mirrors the challenge of recreating programming projects with evolving technologies.

In the context of reviving old programming work, Inari embodies the transformative process of taking foundational concepts and reshaping them through new technological approaches. The goal is to systematically review GitHub repositories, rebuild projects with modern practices, and fully document everything for future reference.

# Implementation

## Phase 1: Archaeological (巣)

Comprehensive cataloging of existing programming projects. Document original functionality, architectural decisions, and lessons learned from previous implementations.

## Phase 2: Transformation (飛翔)

Rebuild core functionality using contemporary technologies and improved architectures. Focus on preserving essential value while leveraging modern capabilities.

## Phase 3: Evolution (空)

Enhance reconstructed projects with capabilities that were impossible in original implementations. Add modern integrations and expand feature sets.
